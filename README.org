* Runomatic --- a Bot & API Client for [[https://runogame.com/][runogame.com]]
While hanging out with some friends on a Saturday evening, we wanted to play
Uno, and found a FOSS Uno webapp, we wanted to add additional players to make
the game more interesting.  Plus it would be fun to play bots against
each other.  As a result I wrote this quick 'n dirty "API Client" to the Runo
API, and a simple rule-based bot to play the game.

** Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
raco pkg install --link  # From the git repository
raco pkg install --auto runomatic
#+END_SRC
** Usage
In addition to using the API client and bot utility procedures to build your
own GUIs or bots, you can use the CLI bot:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
runomatic --new-game 2  # Start a new game for one other player
runomatic --game-id S39YMGjYmSsBpHbrnQTVkJqgRxw7tdXk6OmRzi6PJHw9LdD1  # Join a game using the Game ID
runomatic --name hal9000 --game-name Game70512  # Join a game using the Game Name with player name hal9000
# Join as an existing player on a game
runomatic --game-descriptor S39YMGjYmSsBpHbrnQTVkJqgRxw7tdXk6OmRzi6PJHw9LdD1:9p0X8W87LH8nujcLoGKDMVFIT5u1daR7LlybTKzKnTeJGR2z

** Thank you
Thank you to Richard Gieg ([[https://github.com/richgieg][@richgieg]]), the author of [[https://github.com/richgieg/runo][Runo]].  [[https://github.com/richgieg/runogame][See also the runo rewrite]].
** Style
This uses standard Racket style, except for two items:
- Parameters should start and end with an asterisk :: =(define *my-parameter*
     (make-parameter #f))=
- Structs should be camel cased because this means instances will never redefine their binding :: 
  =(struct MyStruct (a b c))=
